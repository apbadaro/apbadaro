I’m Ana Paula, a **seasoned subtitler and quality control specialist** with **15 years of experience** in audiovisual translation and workflow optimization for global media platforms. Over the years, I’ve contributed to high-quality subtitling projects for streaming giants like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+, working with talented teams to ensure linguistic consistency and cultural accuracy.  

While I continue to work in subtitling and QC, my passion is driving me towards the **technical side of localization**, focusing on **backend technologies**. I'm learning **Python**, **Django**, and **Java**, and exploring how these technologies can optimize localization workflows, particularly in **AI-driven solutions** and **automation**.  

My ultimate goal is to combine my strong background in localization with my growing technical skills to help **shape the future of localization backend systems**, ensuring that the process is as efficient, scalable, and tech-forward as possible.

### Current Learning Path
- **Technologist in Systems Analysis and Development:** *Basic FrontEnd Certificate (Ongoing)*  
- **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python**  

Feel free to reach out if you’re interested in discussing **backend development**, **localization technology**, or **AI-driven solutions** in tech! 😊
